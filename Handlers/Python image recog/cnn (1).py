# ## TensorFlow Graph
# 
# The entire purpose of TensorFlow is to have a so-called computational graph that can be executed much more efficiently than if the same calculations were to be performed directly in Python. TensorFlow can be more efficient than NumPy because TensorFlow knows the entire computation graph that must be executed, while NumPy only knows the computation of a single mathematical operation at a time.
# 
# TensorFlow can also automatically calculate the gradients that are needed to optimize the variables of the graph so as to make the model perform better. This is because the graph is a combination of simple mathematical expressions so the gradient of the entire graph can be calculated using the chain-rule for derivatives.
# 
# A TensorFlow graph consists of the following parts which will be detailed below:
# 
# * Placeholder variables used for inputting data to the graph.
# * Variables that are going to be optimized so as to make the convolutional network perform better.
# * The mathematical formulas for the convolutional network.
# * A cost measure that can be used to guide the optimization of the variables.
# * An optimization method which updates the variables.

# ### Helper-functions for creating new variables

# Functions for creating new TensorFlow variables in the given shape and initializing them with random values. Note that the initialization is not actually done at this point, it is merely being defined in the TensorFlow graph.

# In[7]:


def new_weights(shape):

# ### Helper-function for creating a new Convolutional Layer

# This function creates a new convolutional layer in the computational graph for TensorFlow. Nothing is actually calculated here, we are just adding the mathematical formulas to the TensorFlow graph.
# 
# It is assumed that the input is a 4-dim tensor with the following dimensions:
# 
# 1. Image number.
# 2. Y-axis of each image.
# 3. X-axis of each image.
# 4. Channels of each image.
# 
# Note that the input channels may either be colour-channels, or it may be filter-channels if the input is produced from a previous convolutional layer.
# 
# The output is another 4-dim tensor with the following dimensions:
# 
# 1. Image number, same as input.
# 2. Y-axis of each image. If 2x2 pooling is used, then the height and width of the input images is divided by 2.
# 3. X-axis of each image. Ditto.
# 4. Channels produced by the convolutional filters.

# In[9]:

    biases = new_biases(length=num_filters)

    # Create the TensorFlow operation for convolution.
    # Note the strides are set to 1 in all dimensions.
    # The first and last stride must always be 1,
    # because the first is for the image-number and
    # the last is for the input-channel.
    # But e.g. strides=[1, 2, 2, 1] would mean that the filter
    # is moved 2 pixels across the x- and y-axis of the image.
    # The padding is set to 'SAME' which means the input image
    # is padded with zeroes so the size of the output is the same.
    layer = tf.nn.conv2d(input=input,
                         filter=weights,

    # Use pooling to down-sample the image resolution?
    if use_pooling:
        # This is 2x2 max-pooling, which means that we
        # consider 2x2 windows and select the largest value
        # in each window. Then we move 2 pixels to the next window.
        layer = tf.nn.max_pool(value=layer,
                               ksize=[1, 2, 2, 1],

    # Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU).
    # It calculates max(x, 0) for each input pixel x.
    # This adds some non-linearity to the formula and allows us
    # to learn more complicated functions.
    layer = tf.nn.relu(layer)

    # Note that ReLU is normally executed before the pooling,
    # but since relu(max_pool(x)) == max_pool(relu(x)) we can
    # save 75% of the relu-operations by max-pooling first.

    # We return both the resulting layer and the filter-weights
    # because we will plot the weights later.
    return layer, weights


# ### Helper-function for flattening a layer
# 
# A convolutional layer produces an output tensor with 4 dimensions. We will add fully-connected layers after the convolution layers, so we need to reduce the 4-dim tensor to 2-dim which can be used as input to the fully-connected layer.

# In[10]:


def flatten_layer(layer):
    # Get the shape of the input layer.
    layer_shape = layer.get_shape()

    # The shape of the input layer is assumed to be:
    # layer_shape == [num_images, img_height, img_width, num_channels]

    # The number of features is: img_height * img_width * num_channels
    # We can use a function from TensorFlow to calculate this.
    num_features = layer_shape[1:4].num_elements()
    
    # Reshape the layer to [num_images, num_features].
    # Note that we just set the size of the second dimension
    # to num_features and the size of the first dimension to -1
    # which means the size in that dimension is calculated
    # so the total size of the tensor is unchanged from the reshaping.
    layer_flat = tf.reshape(layer, [-1, num_features])

    # The shape of the flattened layer is now:
    # [num_images, img_height * img_width * num_channels]

    # Return both the flattened layer and the number of features.
    return layer_flat, num_features


# ### Helper-function for creating a new Fully-Connected Layer

# This function creates a new fully-connected layer in the computational graph for TensorFlow. Nothing is actually calculated here, we are just adding the mathematical formulas to the TensorFlow graph.
# 
# It is assumed that the input is a 2-dim tensor of shape `[num_images, num_inputs]`. The output is a 2-dim tensor of shape `[num_images, num_outputs]`.

# In[11]:


def new_fc_layer(input,          # The previous layer.
                 num_inputs,     # Num. inputs from prev. layer.
                 num_outputs,    # Num. outputs.
                 use_relu=True): # Use Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)?

    # Create new weights and biases.
    weights = new_weights(shape=[num_inputs, num_outputs])
    biases = new_biases(length=num_outputs)

    # Calculate the layer as the matrix multiplication of
    # the input and weights, and then add the bias-values.
    layer = tf.matmul(input, weights) + biases

    # Use ReLU?
    if use_relu:
        layer = tf.nn.relu(layer)

    return layer


# ### Placeholder variables

# Placeholder variables serve as the input to the TensorFlow computational graph that we may change each time we execute the graph. We call this feeding the placeholder variables and it is demonstrated further below.
# 
# First we define the placeholder variable for the input images. This allows us to change the images that are input to the TensorFlow graph. This is a so-called tensor, which just means that it is a multi-dimensional vector or matrix. The data-type is set to `float32` and the shape is set to `[None, img_size_flat]`, where `None` means that the tensor may hold an arbitrary number of images with each image being a vector of length `img_size_flat`.

# In[12]:


x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, img_size_flat], name='x')


# The convolutional layers expect `x` to be encoded as a 4-dim tensor so we have to reshape it so its shape is instead `[num_images, img_height, img_width, num_channels]`. Note that `img_height == img_width == img_size` and `num_images` can be inferred automatically by using -1 for the size of the first dimension. So the reshape operation is:

# In[13]:


x_image = tf.reshape(x, [-1, img_size, img_size, num_channels])


# Next we have the placeholder variable for the true labels associated with the images that were input in the placeholder variable `x`. The shape of this placeholder variable is `[None, num_classes]` which means it may hold an arbitrary number of labels and each label is a vector of length `num_classes`.

# In[14]:


y_true = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, num_classes], name='y_true')


# We could also have a placeholder variable for the class-number, but we will instead calculate it using argmax. Note that this is a TensorFlow operator so nothing is calculated at this point.

# In[15]:


y_true_cls = tf.argmax(y_true, dimension=1)


# ### Convolutional Layer 1
# 
# Create the first convolutional layer. It takes `x_image` as input and creates `num_filters1` different filters, each having width and height equal to `filter_size1`. Finally we wish to down-sample the image so it is half the size by using 2x2 max-pooling.

# In[16]:


layer_conv1, weights_conv1 =     new_conv_layer(input=x_image,
                   num_input_channels=num_channels,
                   filter_size=filter_size1,
                   num_filters=num_filters1,
                   use_pooling=True)


# In[17]:


layer_conv1


# ### Convolutional Layers 2 and 3
# 
# Create the second and third convolutional layers, which take as input the output from the first and second convolutional layer respectively. The number of input channels corresponds to the number of filters in the previous convolutional layer.

# In[18]:


layer_conv2, weights_conv2 =     new_conv_layer(input=layer_conv1,
                   num_input_channels=num_filters1,
                   filter_size=filter_size2,
                   num_filters=num_filters2,
                   use_pooling=True)


# In[19]:


layer_conv2


# In[20]:


layer_conv3, weights_conv3 =     new_conv_layer(input=layer_conv2,
                   num_input_channels=num_filters2,
                   filter_size=filter_size3,
                   num_filters=num_filters3,
                   use_pooling=True)


# In[21]:


layer_conv3


# ### Flatten Layer
# 
# The convolutional layers output 4-dim tensors. We now wish to use these as input in a fully-connected network, which requires for the tensors to be reshaped or flattened to 2-dim tensors.

# In[22]:


layer_flat, num_features = flatten_layer(layer_conv3)


# In[23]:


layer_flat


# In[24]:


num_features


# ### Fully-Connected Layer 1
# 
# Add a fully-connected layer to the network. The input is the flattened layer from the previous convolution. The number of neurons or nodes in the fully-connected layer is `fc_size`. ReLU is used so we can learn non-linear relations.

# In[25]:


layer_fc1 = new_fc_layer(input=layer_flat,
                         num_inputs=num_features,
                         num_outputs=fc_size,
                         use_relu=True)


# Check that the output of the fully-connected layer is a tensor with shape (?, 128) where the ? means there is an arbitrary number of images and `fc_size` == 128.

# In[26]:


layer_fc1


# ### Fully-Connected Layer 2
# 
# Add another fully-connected layer that outputs vectors of length num_classes for determining which of the classes the input image belongs to. Note that ReLU is not used in this layer.

# In[27]:


layer_fc2 = new_fc_layer(input=layer_fc1,
                         num_inputs=fc_size,
                         num_outputs=num_classes,
                         use_relu=False)


# In[28]:


layer_fc2


# ### Predicted Class

# The second fully-connected layer estimates how likely it is that the input image belongs to each of the 2 classes. However, these estimates are a bit rough and difficult to interpret because the numbers may be very small or large, so we want to normalize them so that each element is limited between zero and one and the all the elements sum to one. This is calculated using the so-called softmax function and the result is stored in `y_pred`.

# In[29]:


y_pred = tf.nn.softmax(layer_fc2)


# The class-number is the index of the largest element.

# In[30]:


y_pred_cls = tf.argmax(y_pred, dimension=1)


# ### Cost-function to be optimized

# To make the model better at classifying the input images, we must somehow change the variables for all the network layers. To do this we first need to know how well the model currently performs by comparing the predicted output of the model `y_pred` to the desired output `y_true`.
# 
# The cross-entropy is a performance measure used in classification. The cross-entropy is a continuous function that is always positive and if the predicted output of the model exactly matches the desired output then the cross-entropy equals zero. The goal of optimization is therefore to minimize the cross-entropy so it gets as close to zero as possible by changing the variables of the network layers.
# 
# TensorFlow has a built-in function for calculating the cross-entropy. Note that the function calculates the softmax internally so we must use the output of `layer_fc2` directly rather than `y_pred` which has already had the softmax applied.

# In[31]:


cross_entropy = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits=layer_fc2,
                                                        labels=y_true)


# We have now calculated the cross-entropy for each of the image classifications so we have a measure of how well the model performs on each image individually. But in order to use the cross-entropy to guide the optimization of the model's variables we need a single scalar value, so we simply take the average of the cross-entropy for all the image classifications.

# In[32]:


cost = tf.reduce_mean(cross_entropy)


# ### Optimization Method

# Now that we have a cost measure that must be minimized, we can then create an optimizer. In this case it is the `AdamOptimizer` which is an advanced form of Gradient Descent.
# 
# Note that optimization is not performed at this point. In fact, nothing is calculated at all, we just add the optimizer-object to the TensorFlow graph for later execution.

# In[33]:


optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=1e-4).minimize(cost)


# ### Performance Measures

# We need a few more performance measures to display the progress to the user.
# 
# This is a vector of booleans whether the predicted class equals the true class of each image.

# In[34]:


correct_prediction = tf.equal(y_pred_cls, y_true_cls)


# This calculates the classification accuracy by first type-casting the vector of booleans to floats, so that False becomes 0 and True becomes 1, and then calculating the average of these numbers.

# In[35]:


accuracy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(correct_prediction, tf.float32))


# ## TensorFlow Run

# ### Create TensorFlow session
# 
# Once the TensorFlow graph has been created, we have to create a TensorFlow session which is used to execute the graph.

# In[36]:


session = tf.Session()


# ### Initialize variables
# 
# The variables for `weights` and `biases` must be initialized before we start optimizing them.

# In[37]:


session.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())


# ### Helper-function to perform optimization iterations

# It takes a long time to calculate the gradient of the model using the entirety of a large dataset
# . We therefore only use a small batch of images in each iteration of the optimizer.
# 
# If your computer crashes or becomes very slow because you run out of RAM, then you may try and lower this number, but you may then need to perform more optimization iterations.

# In[38]:


train_batch_size = batch_size

    # Calculate the accuracy on the training-set.

# Function for performing a number of optimization iterations so as to gradually improve the variables of the network layers.

# ### Helper-function for showing the performance

# Function for printing the classification accuracy on the test-set.
# 
# It takes a while to compute the classification for all the images in the test-set, that's why the results are re-used by calling the above functions directly from this function, so the classifications don't have to be recalculated by each function.
# 
# Note that this function can use a lot of computer memory, which is why the test-set is split into smaller batches. If you have little RAM in your computer and it crashes, then you can try and lower the batch-size.
